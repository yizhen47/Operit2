# Building Operit2

This file describes how to build, run, and package Operit2 from the repository root.

Rust build warnings are currently expected. Treat command exit status as the signal for build success.

## Built-In Workflow Plugin

The workflow plugin is a pnpm project. Its `package.json` pins the package
manager to pnpm 10.7.0; use Corepack so local commands honor that pin. The
pnpm lockfile is the dependency source of truth. Do not use npm in this package.

From the workflow package directory:

```powershell
corepack pnpm --version
corepack pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
corepack pnpm run pack:toolpkg
corepack pnpm run test:web
```

`plugins/tools/sync_plugin_packages.py` invokes the package build through
Corepack, so automated synchronization uses the version pinned in `package.json`.

## Rust Targets

Windows CLI release builds use:

```powershell
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
rustup target add aarch64-pc-windows-msvc
```

Fedora WSL Linux CLI release builds use these Rust targets:

```bash
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
sudo dnf install -y musl-gcc musl-devel musl-libc-static gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu sysroot-aarch64-fc43-glibc
```

The aarch64 Linux CLI release requires an `aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc` cross C compiler and
the Fedora `/usr/aarch64-redhat-linux/sys-root/fc43` sysroot. The build release script injects
the sysroot's `limits.h` while compiling C dependencies because Fedora's cross compiler
is built without target headers.

## Local CLI Checks

Run from the repository root.

```powershell
cargo check --manifest-path apps/cli/Cargo.toml
cargo run --manifest-path apps/cli/Cargo.toml --bin operit2 -- cli version
```

Run the TUI:

```powershell
cargo run --manifest-path apps/cli/Cargo.toml --bin operit2 -- tui
```

Run update checks:

```powershell
cargo run --manifest-path apps/cli/Cargo.toml --bin operit2 -- cli update target
cargo run --manifest-path apps/cli/Cargo.toml --bin operit2 -- cli update check 0.0.0-preview.0
cargo run --manifest-path apps/cli/Cargo.toml --bin operit2 -- tui --update-current-version 0.0.0-preview.0
```

## Build Release Script

Interactive release helper:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\release\release_interactive.py
```

Direct build release script:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\release\build_release.py
```

Environment check only:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\build_scripts\build_local.py --products all --cli-arches host --check
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\release\build_release.py --scope full --cli-arches all --check-environment
```

Scopes:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\release\build_release.py --scope cli
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\release\build_release.py --scope app
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\release\build_release.py --scope full
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\release\build_release.py --scope none --no-wsl
```

Build only:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\release\build_release.py --scope cli
```

`tools/release/dist` is the shared staging directory for local, SSH-collected,
and GitHub Actions assets. `build_release.py` keeps existing staged files so
platform builds can be composed. Start a new staged set explicitly with:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\release\build_release.py --scope cli --clean-dist
```

Release environment assumptions:

```text
Local Windows build_release.py:
  Builds Android, OpenHarmony, Windows App, Windows CLI, and WSL Linux assets.
  Requires Windows build tools, Android/OpenHarmony signing files, and Fedora WSL
  when WSL Linux assets are selected.

Local build_local.py:
  Builds only the current host App and/or CLI after checking the current host
  requirements. macOS can add unsigned iOS with --include-ios.

GitHub Actions:
  Apple Release Build, macOS Flutter Build, iOS Flutter Build, Windows Release
  Build, Linux Release Build, and Android Flutter Build are manual cloud
  entrypoints. Artifacts downloaded from cloud runs are collected into
  tools/release/dist with download_action_artifacts.py.
```

Cloud build composition:

```text
1. Trigger the platform workflows needed for this release.
2. Wait for every selected workflow to succeed.
3. Collect every run into tools/release/dist with one --run-id per run.
4. Run publish_dist.py only when the collected files are ready to publish.
```

Successful App and full builds advance the Flutter build number in
`apps/flutter/app/pubspec.yaml` after their assets are packaged. CLI-only builds do not
change it.

CLI architecture selection:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\release\build_release.py --scope cli --cli-arches host
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\release\build_release.py --scope cli --cli-arches all
```

On Windows, `--cli-arches all` builds:

```text
operit2-cli-windows-x86_64.zip
operit2-cli-windows-aarch64.zip
operit2-cli-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
operit2-cli-linux-aarch64.tar.gz
```

Cloud workflows are independent manual `workflow_dispatch` entrypoints. The
Apple aggregate workflow invokes the reusable macOS and iOS workflows; the
other workflows build exactly one platform family:

```text
Apple Release Build       macOS App, macOS CLI, and unsigned iOS App
macOS Flutter Build       macOS App and/or CLI
iOS Flutter Build         unsigned iOS App
Windows Release Build     Windows App and/or CLI
Linux Release Build       Linux App and/or CLI
Android Flutter Build     signed Android APKs
```

Android Flutter Build requires these repository secrets before it can run:

```text
ANDROID_RELEASE_KEYSTORE_BASE64
ANDROID_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD
ANDROID_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS
ANDROID_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD
```

`ANDROID_RELEASE_KEYSTORE_BASE64` is the Base64 encoding of the Android release
keystore. The workflow writes the signing material only inside its runner.

OpenHarmony has no GitHub Actions workflow yet. Its SDK and command-line tools
are not currently distributed from a reproducible URL available to this
repository, so a cloud workflow cannot provision a valid toolchain. The local
OpenHarmony procedure below remains the supported build path until that SDK
distribution source and the signing secrets are supplied.

```powershell
gh workflow run "Apple Release Build" -f products=all -f include_ios=true -f build_web_assets=false
gh workflow run "macOS Flutter Build" -f products=all -f build_web_assets=false
gh workflow run "iOS Flutter Build" -f build_web_assets=false
gh workflow run "Windows Release Build" -f products=all -f cli_arches=all
gh workflow run "Linux Release Build" -f products=all -f cli_arches=all
gh workflow run "Android Flutter Build"
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\release\download_action_artifacts.py --run-id <apple-run-id> --run-id <windows-run-id> --run-id <linux-run-id> --run-id <android-run-id>
```

`download_action_artifacts.py` accepts only completed successful runs and copies
their release archives into the existing `tools/release/dist` staging directory.

Collaborators can still build the current host locally with one Python command.
Run it from the repository root. On Windows, use the project virtual environment.
On macOS and Linux, use the active Python 3 environment.

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\build_scripts\build_local.py --products all --cli-arches host
```

```bash
python3 tools/build_scripts/build_local.py --products all --cli-arches host
python3 tools/build_scripts/build_local.py --products app --include-ios
```

Local Apple builds require Xcode, Rust, FVM, Node/npm, and Python 3 on the macOS
host. Apple outputs include:

```text
operit2-app-macos-universal.zip
operit2-app-ios-arm64.zip
operit2-cli-macos-x86_64.tar.gz
operit2-cli-macos-aarch64.tar.gz
```

The output directory is:

```text
tools/release/dist
```

Each CLI archive contains:

```text
operit2 or operit2.exe
install.sh or install.bat
uninstall.sh or uninstall.bat
README.txt
```

Skip WSL Linux packaging:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\release\build_release.py --scope cli --cli-arches all --no-wsl
```

## Publishing

Publish the already-built files in `tools/release/dist` to GitHub Release:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\release\publish_dist.py
```

Validate the staged files and GitHub credentials without uploading:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\release\publish_dist.py --check-only
```

Publish staged files as a draft:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\release\publish_dist.py --draft
```

The build release script reads versions from:

```text
apps/cli/Cargo.toml
core/crates/operit-runtime/Cargo.toml
apps/flutter/app/pubspec.yaml
```

Version, tag, build number, and updater asset rules are defined in:

```text
docs/release-versioning.md
```

## Flutter App

The build release script builds app packages through Flutter. Local checks can be run from:

```powershell
cd apps\flutter\app
fvm install --skip-pub-get
fvm dart pub get --enforce-lockfile
```

Windows app release build:

```powershell
fvm flutter build windows --release --no-pub --build-name 2.0.0 --build-number 1
```

Android release build requires signing values in:

```text
tools/release/secrets/android-signing.properties
```

Keep the Android release keystore and properties outside git and back them up:

```text
tools/release/secrets/operit2-release.keystore
tools/release/secrets/android-signing.properties
```

## OpenHarmony Flutter App

OpenHarmony builds require the OpenHarmony Flutter SDK maintained at:

```text
https://gitcode.com/openharmony-sig/flutter_flutter.git
```

The Flutter app is pinned to the OpenHarmony `oh-3.41.9-dev` branch in
`apps/flutter/app/.fvmrc`. Keep this SDK selected for OpenHarmony development;
the standard Flutter SDK is a different toolchain and does not provide the
OpenHarmony target.

The user environment must provide:

- FVM `4.1.2` through the Pub cache `bin` directory on `PATH`.
- `dart` through a Flutter or Dart SDK `bin` directory on `PATH` so the FVM
  launcher can start.
- `OHOS_SDK_HOME` pointing to the OpenHarmony SDK root.
- The selected OpenHarmony SDK `toolchains` directory on `PATH` for `hdc`.

Restart the terminal or IDE after changing user environment variables so new
processes inherit them.

The Windows user environment used for local OpenHarmony builds should keep
these values stable:

```text
HOS_SDK_HOME=%USERPROFILE%\harmony-tools\harmonyos-sdk
OHOS_SDK_HOME=%USERPROFILE%\harmony-tools\harmonyos-sdk
DEVECO_SDK_HOME=%USERPROFILE%\harmony-tools\harmonyos-sdk
```

Add these directories to the user `PATH`:

```text
%USERPROFILE%\harmony-tools\commandline-tools-2.0.0.2\command-line-tools\bin
%USERPROFILE%\harmony-tools\ohcommandline-tools-2.0.0.2\oh-command-line-tools\bin
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Pub\Cache\bin
```

The project-local OpenHarmony properties file should point at the same SDK and
the FVM-selected Flutter SDK:

```text
apps/flutter/app/ohos/local.properties
hwsdk.dir=<user-home>\\harmony-tools\\harmonyos-sdk
flutter.sdk=<repo-root>\\apps\\flutter\\app\\.fvm\\flutter_sdk
```

The SDK root must contain a numeric API directory with all build components.
The currently validated layout is:

```text
%USERPROFILE%\harmony-tools\harmonyos-sdk\18\ets
%USERPROFILE%\harmony-tools\harmonyos-sdk\18\js
%USERPROFILE%\harmony-tools\harmonyos-sdk\18\native
%USERPROFILE%\harmony-tools\harmonyos-sdk\18\previewer
%USERPROFILE%\harmony-tools\harmonyos-sdk\18\toolchains
```

Do not point this project at `%USERPROFILE%\harmony-tools\openharmony-sdk\9`;
that older SDK does not match the current OpenHarmony API 18 project files.

The FVM-selected SDK must expose the `ohos` platform and the `hap` build
command. Verify the selected SDK and DevEco environment from the Flutter app
directory:

```powershell
cd apps\flutter\app
fvm install --skip-pub-get
fvm flutter doctor -v
fvm flutter config
```

`fvm flutter doctor -v` must report both Flutter and OpenHarmony toolchains.

Generate the OpenHarmony application module once with the selected SDK:

```powershell
cd apps\flutter\app
fvm flutter create --platforms ohos .
```

Build the shared Web Access bundle from the repository root:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\build_scripts\build_flutter_web_access.py --base-href /
```

The remote access bundle is written to `apps/web_access/build/bundle` and
synchronized into the native Flutter assets at:

```text
apps/flutter/app/assets/web_access
```

The bundle includes a generated `web_access_version.json`; native launchers use
that version to reuse an already materialized Web Access directory.

Build the OpenHarmony HAP with the repository script. The script invokes the
same FVM-selected Flutter SDK and the OpenHarmony native toolchain:

The Rust toolchain uses the native OpenHarmony target:

```powershell
rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-ohos
```

Build the HAP through the repository build script from the repository root:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\build_scripts\build_flutter_ohos.py --enforce-lockfile
```

The build script stages the Rust bridge, copies the OpenHarmony Flutter engine
HAR files, patches the embedding HAR for the local API 18 SDK surface, clears
the unpacked `ohpm` embedding package, runs `flutter build hap`, and signs the
unsigned HAP with the project OpenHarmony release signing material in:

```text
tools/release/secrets/ohos-signing/ohos-signing.properties
```

Keep these OpenHarmony release signing files outside git and back them up:

```text
tools/release/secrets/ohos-signing/operit-ohos-release-app.p12
tools/release/secrets/ohos-signing/operit-ohos-release-app.cer
tools/release/secrets/ohos-signing/operit-ohos-release-profile.p12
tools/release/secrets/ohos-signing/operit-ohos-release-profile.cer
tools/release/secrets/ohos-signing/ohos-signing.properties
```

The generated per-build profile files are written under:

```text
apps/flutter/app/ohos/signing
```

That directory is ignored by git and should be treated as local build output.

The signed build output is copied to:

```text
tools/release/dist/operit2-app-ohos-arm64.hap
```

If the Flutter command reports `Can't load Kernel binary`, clear stale FVM or
Flutter snapshot state for this app, run `fvm install --skip-pub-get` from
`apps/flutter/app`, and run the OpenHarmony build script again from the
repository root.

## Useful Cleanup

Remove release output:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force tools\release\dist, tools\release\work
```

Remove Rust build output for the CLI:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force apps\cli\target
```

Use cleanup commands only for build artifacts.
