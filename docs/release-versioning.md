# Operit2 Release Versioning

This document is the source of truth for Operit2 app and CLI release versions.

## Version Format

Operit2 uses SemVer-compatible versions:

```text
stable:  2.0.0
preview: 2.0.0-preview.1
rc:      2.0.0-rc.1
dev:     2.0.0-dev.20260619
```

Git tags use the same version with a leading `v`:

```text
v2.0.0-preview.1
v2.0.0-rc.1
v2.0.0
```

Build metadata is allowed and does not change update ordering:

```text
2.0.0+20260619.shaabcdef
```

Do not use build metadata as a release counter. Use prerelease identifiers for public preview builds.

## Ordering

Version ordering follows SemVer precedence:

```text
2.0.0-dev.20260619 < 2.0.0-preview.1 < 2.0.0-preview.2 < 2.0.0-rc.1 < 2.0.0
```

Stable versions are newer than prerelease versions with the same major, minor, and patch numbers.

## Channels

Updater channel is derived from the current installed version:

```text
current stable version      -> stable channel
current prerelease version  -> preview channel
```

Stable channel accepts only stable GitHub releases.

Preview channel accepts prerelease and stable GitHub releases.

## GitHub Releases

Release tags and GitHub release flags must agree:

```text
v2.0.0-preview.1  -> GitHub prerelease = true
v2.0.0-rc.1       -> GitHub prerelease = true
v2.0.0            -> GitHub prerelease = false
```

Draft releases are ignored by the updater.

The publish script derives the GitHub prerelease flag from the tag version. Prerelease tags publish as GitHub prereleases. Stable tags publish as stable GitHub releases.

The first public Operit2 preview should use:

```text
v2.0.0-preview.1
```

The first stable Operit2 release should use:

```text
v2.0.0
```

## Package Assets

Release asset names are fixed by product, platform, and architecture. They do not include the version number.

```text
operit2-cli-windows-x86_64.zip
operit2-cli-windows-aarch64.zip
operit2-cli-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
operit2-cli-linux-aarch64.tar.gz
operit2-cli-macos-x86_64.tar.gz
operit2-cli-macos-aarch64.tar.gz
operit2-app-android-arm64-v8a.apk
operit2-app-android-armeabi-v7a.apk
operit2-app-android-x86_64.apk
operit2-app-ohos-arm64.hap
operit2-app-windows-x86_64.zip
operit2-app-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
operit2-app-macos-universal.zip
operit2-app-ios-arm64.zip
```

The version lives in the Git tag and package metadata.

CLI archives contain the executable, installer script, uninstaller script, and README. The archive asset name remains the updater target.

A GitHub Release may contain only the selected scope's assets. The updater selects releases by exact target asset name, so an app client does not treat a CLI-only release as an app update.

## Version Sources

The Operit2 release version is the full SemVer value used by the updater:

```text
apps/cli/Cargo.toml                         package.version
core/crates/runtime/application/Cargo.toml       package.version
```

These two values must be identical. They must not include build metadata. The CLI uses its Cargo package version as `cliVersion`. The app exposes `coreVersion` from `operit-runtime`.

Flutter platform metadata is separate from the Operit2 release version:

```text
apps/flutter/app/pubspec.yaml               version: major.minor.patch+buildNumber
```

For `2.0.0-preview.1`, the Flutter platform version is:

```text
2.0.0+1
```

The build and publish scripts use the full Operit2 SemVer for Git tags and updater metadata. The Flutter `major.minor.patch` must match the Operit2 release version. Flutter `buildNumber` is only platform package metadata for Android, Windows, Linux, and macOS builds.

For App and full runs, the build release script builds with the current Flutter `buildNumber` and then increments `apps/flutter/app/pubspec.yaml` by 1 after all selected App assets succeed. CLI-only runs do not change the Flutter `buildNumber`.

## Build Release Script

The build release script is:

```text
tools/release/build_release.py
```

GitHub publish credentials live in:

```text
tools/release/secrets/github.env
```

That directory is ignored by git.

Default publish command on Windows:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\release\publish_dist.py
```

Release scope:

```powershell
# CLI/TUI only
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\release\build_release.py --scope cli

# App only
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\release\build_release.py --scope app

# App and CLI/TUI
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\release\build_release.py --scope full
```

`build_release.py` only builds release assets. `publish_dist.py` uploads files
already staged in `tools/release/dist`.

`tools/release/dist` accumulates assets from local builds, SSH collection, and
GitHub Actions downloads. Use `--clean-dist` with `build_release.py` only when
starting a new staged release set:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\release\build_release.py --scope cli --clean-dist
```

CLI architecture selection:

```powershell
# Current host architecture only
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\release\build_release.py --scope cli --cli-arches host

# x86_64 and aarch64 for the current desktop platforms available from this host
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\release\build_release.py --scope cli --cli-arches all
```

On Windows, `--cli-arches all` builds Windows x86_64 and Windows aarch64 locally, and Linux x86_64 and Linux aarch64 through WSL. Windows aarch64 requires the Rust target, Visual Studio ARM64 build tools, and LLVM clang. Linux aarch64 in Fedora WSL requires:

Before a local release build, run the environment check for the selected scope:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\release\build_release.py --scope full --cli-arches all --check-environment
```

```bash
rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
sudo dnf install -y gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu sysroot-aarch64-fc43-glibc cpio
dnf5 --forcearch=aarch64 download libgcc
rpm2cpio libgcc-*.aarch64.rpm | cpio -idmv
sudo cp -a lib64/libgcc_s*.so* /usr/aarch64-redhat-linux/sys-root/fc43/usr/lib64/
sudo ln -sf libgcc_s.so.1 /usr/aarch64-redhat-linux/sys-root/fc43/usr/lib64/libgcc_s.so
```

Cloud release builds are composable. All available platform workflows are manual
`workflow_dispatch` entrypoints; macOS and iOS are additionally reusable through
`workflow_call` from Apple Release Build:

```text
Apple Release Build       macOS App, macOS CLI, unsigned iOS App
macOS Flutter Build       macOS App and/or CLI
iOS Flutter Build         unsigned iOS App
Windows Release Build     Windows App and/or CLI
Linux Release Build       Linux App and/or CLI
Android Flutter Build     signed Android APKs
```

Android Flutter Build requires these repository secrets:

```text
ANDROID_RELEASE_KEYSTORE_BASE64
ANDROID_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD
ANDROID_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS
ANDROID_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD
```

The Android keystore secret must be Base64 encoded. OpenHarmony remains a local
build because this repository has no reproducible distribution URL for its SDK
and command-line tools. Do not treat it as an available cloud build until that
external toolchain source and the signing secrets are configured.

```powershell
gh workflow run "Apple Release Build" -f products=all -f include_ios=true -f build_web_assets=false
gh workflow run "macOS Flutter Build" -f products=all -f build_web_assets=false
gh workflow run "iOS Flutter Build" -f build_web_assets=false
gh workflow run "Windows Release Build" -f products=all -f cli_arches=all
gh workflow run "Linux Release Build" -f products=all -f cli_arches=all
gh workflow run "Android Flutter Build"
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\release\download_action_artifacts.py --run-id <apple-run-id> --run-id <windows-run-id> --run-id <linux-run-id> --run-id <android-run-id>
```

`download_action_artifacts.py` verifies that every requested run completed with
the `success` conclusion before copying release assets into `tools/release/dist`.
Publish the collected files through `publish_dist.py` when the release set is
complete.

Collaborators can build the current host locally with one Python entrypoint. On
macOS, `--include-ios` also builds the unsigned iOS archive when the iOS Xcode
platform component is installed:

```bash
python3 tools/build_scripts/build_local.py --products all --cli-arches host
python3 tools/build_scripts/build_local.py --products app --include-ios
python3 tools/build_scripts/build_local.py --products esp32
```

The ESP32 local build requires the ESP-IDF Rust toolchain, `espflash`, `ldproxy`,
and an `EMSDK` environment variable. It writes the board-specific ZIP bundle to
`tools/release/dist/operit2-esp32-esp32-2432s028.zip`. The bundle contains the
full 4 MiB initial-flash image, split flash images, `partitions.csv`, and a
manifest with verified offsets and SHA-256 digests.

The release scripts read GitHub credentials from:

```text
tools/release/secrets/github.env
```

Required keys:

```text
GITHUB_TOKEN
GITHUB_API_URL
```

Publishing existing build outputs is handled by:

```text
tools/release/publish_dist.py
```

It uploads the files already staged in `tools/release/dist` without rebuilding:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\release\publish_dist.py
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\release\publish_dist.py --check-only
```

The default release repository is:

```text
AAswordman/Operit2
```

Use `--repo owner/name` to publish another repository.

The build and publish scripts must enforce these rules:

- Read Cargo package versions with TOML parsing.
- Read Flutter platform build metadata from `pubspec.yaml`.
- Reject mismatched CLI and runtime release versions.
- Reject Cargo and runtime release versions that include build metadata.
- Reject Flutter platform versions whose `major.minor.patch` differs from the Cargo release version.
- Reject a `--tag` value that differs from the Cargo release version.
- Derive the GitHub prerelease flag from the release version.
- Build only the selected `--scope` assets.
- Increment Flutter `buildNumber` by 1 after successful App/full asset builds.
- Publish staged files through the GitHub REST API with `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
- Check an existing GitHub release's prerelease flag before uploading staged files.

For the first public preview:

```text
apps/cli/Cargo.toml                    version = "2.0.0-preview.1"
core/crates/runtime/application/Cargo.toml  version = "2.0.0-preview.1"
apps/flutter/app/pubspec.yaml          version: 2.0.0+1
GitHub tag                             v2.0.0-preview.1
```

## Runtime Implementation

The updater implementation is in:

```text
core/crates/runtime/application/src/util/GithubReleaseUtil.rs
```

The implementation must keep these rules:

- Parse versions strictly as `major.minor.patch[-prerelease][+build]`.
- Ignore build metadata during version comparison.
- Select releases by updater channel.
- Match assets by fixed asset name.
- Reject mismatched GitHub prerelease flags.

## Update Testing

Show the updater target for the current desktop CLI:

```powershell
cargo run --manifest-path apps/cli/Cargo.toml -- cli update target
```

Check whether a release is available without downloading:

```powershell
cargo run --manifest-path apps/cli/Cargo.toml -- cli update check 0.0.0-preview.0
```

Download the matching asset and show progress without installing it:

```powershell
cargo run --manifest-path apps/cli/Cargo.toml -- cli update download 0.0.0-preview.0
```

Run the full CLI update path, including install overwrite when the current target matches:

```powershell
cargo run --manifest-path apps/cli/Cargo.toml -- cli update run 0.0.0-preview.0
```

Force the TUI startup update prompt with a test current version:

```powershell
cargo run --manifest-path apps/cli/Cargo.toml -- tui --update-current-version 0.0.0-preview.0
```

Use a prerelease current version such as `0.0.0-preview.0` to test preview releases. A stable current version such as `0.0.0` selects the stable channel and ignores GitHub prereleases.
